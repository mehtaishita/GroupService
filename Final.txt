You will take your GroupService with multicasting implementation from Homework 5 and improve it by making it fully-distributed across multiple machines/JVMs and adding most of the following features:
Refactor the code to use Akka Cluster 
Provide some type of reasonable message ordering guarantees 
Implement well defined group membership (i.e., joining and leaving) protocols so actors do not receive messages meant for groups they are no longer in.
